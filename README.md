#Usage
> A router is able to convert a single website to Singles Page Application (SPA).

- Install a command-line http server to serve the content via AJAX, I used [https://github.com/indexzero/http-server], after you can execute `http-server ./ --cors` in the root project.
- Open browser links to httpp://localhost:8080 or whatever port youâ€™ve selected in the http-server.
- Now enjoy the Magic Router
